                Overwatch (retroactively referred to as Overwatch 1) was a 2016 team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment. 
                The game was first released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. Cross-platform play was supported across all platforms.

                Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigned players into two teams of six, with each player selecting from a large roster of characters, 
                known as "heroes", with unique abilities. Teams worked to complete map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. 
                Blizzard added new characters, maps, and game modes post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot boxes to purchase cosmetic items.
