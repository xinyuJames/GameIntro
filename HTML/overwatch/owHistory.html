            <p class="contentText">
                Overwatch is Blizzard's fourth major franchise and came about following the 2014 cancellation of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Titan. 
                A portion of the Titan team were inspired by the success of team-based first-person shooters like Team Fortress 2 and the popularity of multiplayer online battle arena games, 
                creating a hero-based shooter which emphasized teamwork. Some elements of Overwatch borrow concepts from the canceled Titan project.

                Overwatch was unveiled at the 2014 BlizzCon event and was in a closed beta from late 2015 through early 2016. 
                An open beta before release drew in nearly 10 million players. Overwatch received universal acclaim from critics, who praised the game for its accessibility,
                 the diverse appeal of its hero characters, its cartoonish art style, and enjoyable gameplay. Blizzard reported over US$1 billion in revenue during the 
                 first year of its release and had more than 50 million players after three years. Overwatch is considered to be among the greatest video games ever made, 
                 receiving numerous game of the year awards and other accolades.
