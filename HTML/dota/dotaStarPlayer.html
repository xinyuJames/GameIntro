                KuroKy has been a prominent figure in the Dota 2 scene for many years. He is known for his versatile gameplay and leadership as a captain. KuroKy has been part of several successful teams, including Team Liquid, and won The International 7 (TI7).
                <br /><br />
                KuroKy played for a few German DotA teams before joining his first international team, mousesports, where he played with players such as Drayich. This mousesports lineup attended DreamHack Winter 2008 with Puppey acting as stand-in; this was to be the beginning of a long relationship between KuroKy and Puppey.
