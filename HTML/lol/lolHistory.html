                In the game, two teams of five players battle in player-versus-player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. 
                Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. 
                During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. 
                In League's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

                League of Legends has received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value. 
                The game's long lifespan has resulted in a critical reappraisal, with reviews trending positively; it is considered one of the greatest video games ever made. 
                However, negative and abusive in-game player behavior, criticized since the game's early days, persists despite Riot's attempts to fix the problem. 
                In 2019, League regularly peaked at eight million concurrent players, and its popularity has led to tie-ins such as music, comic books, short stories, and the animated series Arcane.
