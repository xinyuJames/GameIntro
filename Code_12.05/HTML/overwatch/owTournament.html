                The Overwatch League (OWL) was a professional esports league for the video game Overwatch, produced by its developer, Blizzard Entertainment. 
                From 2018 to 2023, the Overwatch League followed the model of other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, 
                city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. The league used the regular season and playoffs format rather than promotion and 
                relegation used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, 
                and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on team performance.

                The Overwatch League was announced in 2016 and secured commitments from 12 teams across the United States, Europe, and Asia, 
                each investing $20 million in franchise fees, to participate in its 2018 inaugural season.
